# Digital Geometry Processing, Fall 2024

Welcome to Digital Geometry Processing! In this class, we will be implementing various algorithms on geometric data. The weekly assignments will be implemented with 
the help of three (extremely popular!) libraries: [geometry-central](https://geometry-central.net/surface/geometry/geometry/) (for manipulation of geometric data), [polyscope](https://polyscope.run/) (for visualization of said data), and [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (for numerical linear algebra) . This is the repo will use for all the assigments in the class. It will be updated by the course staff at certain points during the semester. We will provide instructions on how to update your local copy (should be no harder than running `git pull` in your terminal).

### Build Intructions

Detailed build instruction can be found on Piazza in the [Environment Setup Intructions](https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/m01695s4yau24l/m0h7tfi6r9b4c2) handout. Assuming you now have acccess to a unix-like system (linux, macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux), we will quickly run through build intstructions here. `cd` to an accessible directory on your computer and clone this repo. 

`git clone https://github.com/dscrivener/DGP`

Navigate to the newly created folder and make a build directory for build files. 

`mkdir build; cd build`

Run the CMake command to generate the build files 

For Macs with Apple Silicon: `cmake -DCMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR=arm64 ..`

For Anything else: `cmake ..`

In the [Environment Setup Intructions](https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/m01695s4yau24l/m0h7tfi6r9b4c2), there are instructions on how to figure out whether you have an Apple Silicon. 

Run make to build the project. The first compilation may take a few minutes; any subsequent build should only re-compile the files youâ€™ve changed. You can speed this up by using the -j flag to specify the number of threads to use, e.g.
 
`make -j10`

Finally, we can run the executable located at `./build/bin/DGP` where `.` is the root of this repo. For example, if you're in the `/build` folder, you would 
run 

`./bin/DGP`

If everything is succesful, you should see a pop-up window, with a menu for loading meshes and various assignments in the top right.  **Get started with the installations early** so the course staff can help you troubleshoot any issues you run into. 

## Assignments

For every assignment, you will edit the boilerplate code provided to you in a particular file. These files will be located in the `src/` directory named according to the corresponding assignment number. For example, for exercise 1, you will edit code in the `src/ex1.cpp` file. **Do not edit any other files**. In particular, 
`panel.cpp` contains most of the code that does the UI visualization for you, **do not edit this file**. We may be updating this repo through the semester and don't want to run into [merge conflict](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-is-a-merge-conflict-git) down the line. 

Please feel free to reach out to the course staff with any questions!
